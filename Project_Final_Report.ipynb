    "- Scraped Data\n",
    "    - This dataset started its life on various recipe database websites.  Through webscraper code, utilizing BeautifulSoup and open source code as a base, the initial csv of 155,876 lines listed the url, recipe title, total time, and each ingredient as a separate column.  Recipe titles or ingredients which internally contained commas were surrounded by double quotes.\n",

    "For culinary websites looking to capture someone who shifts away from prepackaged foods with clearly-labeled nutritional content, especially with cook-it-yourself meal-delivery services growing in popularity, the need to appeal to home-cooking has created demand to provide nutritional content to consumers. \n",
    "\n",
    "To close these gaps, **we developed an automated process to return nutritional information from an input of raw web scraped recipe data**. This would allow websites to update their entire catalog of recipes to include nutritional data from the USDA and offer a significant advantage in the growing market for home cooking. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would also allow the website to conduct broad surveys of tendencies in nutritional content, ingredient frequencies, and health trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Future Directions**  \n",
    "As we enter our next phase, there are several areas of interest that could be incorporated into our project to both increase its accuracy and widen it's scope. One focus would be to scrape more attributes, particularly location data and insights into ethnic cuisine. Incorporating machine learning techniques would offer the ability to create generic grocery lists based on a unique profile of a site. Natural language processing could be leveraged to more accurately determine the ingredients based on n-gram frequency. Visualizing popular recipes and ingredients by site, using word clouds, offers a custom representation of a website's culinary focus and sytle which carries innate marketing value."

Our feature is distinct from this in that it does not require any input from consumers, since it is geared towards producers (food websites).

This is similar to some of the word matching and recognition done in  our project, but they differ in that the competition criteria was only to determine the ethnic origin of a dish using keywords, while our project focused on actual matching of the ingredients to the USDA nutrition database in order to extract nutritional content. Beyond this, the Kaggle competition used thoroughly cleaned data from only one site through an API. Ours is intended to be used with almost any recipe website and handle raw html data and return nutrition data.  \n",

    "**Data Cleaning / Transformation**  \n",
    "Raw scraped data is first split and all newlines and empty elements are removed. Next, each individual ingredient line is parsed to determine weight and quantity, using a mix of numeric parsing and keyword location for weight measurements (g, ml, tbsp, ounce, cup, etc). Next, the ingredient line is truncated to remove numerics, measurements, and stop words, which allows careful text matching in the USDA food description file. Once a match is made with a high number of matched words in the ingredient and the USDA word description file, the USDA nutritional data file is accessed by food ID, where all data is retrieved (calories, protein, fat, carbs, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unusual Incidents**  \n",
    "There were many edge cases that come up in parsing numeric descriptors. Two, six and a half ounce steaks may be written in many ways. For example:\n",
    "- 2 6 1/2 ounce steaks\n",
    "- 2, 6½ ounce steaks\n",
    "- 2 6 ½ oz. steaks  \n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing this was tricky, and many edge cases were defined in order to handle unusual ascii unicode, as well as to parse between quantities and weights.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Another error-prone issue that has come up regularly that we have not been able to fully control is mis-matching of food descriptions. We used the heuristic that states, **_\"the correct item is the one that (1) contains the highest number of matches and (2) has the shortest length if the there is a tie of the highest number of matches.\"_**. This heuristic isn't always necessarily correct! Often there would be an incorrect match that satisfies the heuristic proprties. For example, _\"fresh garlic bread\"_ may either match with _\"fresh garlic\"_ or _\"fresh bread\"_ in the USDA nutrition databse, leading to a possible error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Values**  \n",
    "Due to the nature of the USDA nutritional data, if a value was not included, it means that it was not measured. These were stored in the dataframe as 'NaN' and were not included in analysis. If it was measured and it was 0, it was included.  "
