    "For culinary websites looking to capture someone who shifts away from prepackaged foods with clearly-labeled nutritional content, especially with cook-it-yourself meal-delivery services growing in popularity, the need to appeal to home-cooking has created demand to provide nutritional content to consumers. \n",
    "\n",
    "To close these gaps, **we developed an automated process to return nutritional information from an input of raw web scraped recipe data**. This would allow websites to update their entire catalog of recipes to include nutritional data from the USDA and offer a significant advantage in the growing market for home cooking. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would also allow the website to conduct broad surveys of tendencies in nutritional content, ingredient frequencies, and health trends. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Future Directions**  \n",
    "As we enter our next phase, there are several areas of interest that could be incorporated into our project to both increase its accuracy and widen it's scope. One focus would be to scrape more attributes, particularly location data and insights into ethnic cuisine. Incorporating machine learning techniques would offer the ability to create generic grocery lists based on a unique profile of a site. Natural language processing could be leveraged to more accurately determine the ingredients based on n-gram frequency. Visualizing popular recipes and ingredients by site, using word clouds, offers a custom representation of a website's culinary focus and sytle which carries innate marketing value."
