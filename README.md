# Nutrition-from-Web-Scraped-Recipes
We are using the web scraper, "beautiful soup" (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), to pull all recipes from a multitude of food websites, followed by the scraping of those individual sites using an established package from github (https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers). We will analyze the nutritional content (from the USDA) of recipes found on a large dataset of online recipes and give comparisons accordingly.
